## Introduction

Acinetobacter baumannii is an aerobic, non-fermentative, non-motile Gram-negative bacillus.[1] A. baumannii can utilize a wide range of carbon sources and is adaptable to soil, water, sewage and hospital environments. As an important opportunistic pathogen, A. baumannii is responsible for severe nosocomial infections including pneumonia, meningits and urinary tract and bloodstream infections. A. baumannii is becoming an increasing threat to patients in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) as a result of its ability to develop multidrug resistance (MDR), which makes it difficult to treat and often leads to high mortality. A. baumannii has become resistant to most antibiotics, including the b-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. The drug resistance genes of A. baumannii are often clustered into antibiotic resistance islands (AbaRs) that target the comM genes. A. baumannii AbaRs in different clonal lineages differ in length and backbone structure. The AbaRs in global clone 1 (GC1) isolate share a backbone transposon, Tn6019, interrupted by a large compound transposon, Tn6018, and AbaR3 is likely to be the original form of AbaRs in GC1 isolates. However, much less is known about the evolution A. baumannii ACICU, was the first resistance island identified in GC2 isolate although it is a AbaR3-variant island. Tn6166 and Tn6167, which were characterized recently in two GC2 isolates, A320 and A91, differ substantially from the AbaR3-type islands found in GC1 isolates. here we present a comparative analysis based on whole-genome sequencing of A. baumannii MDR-TJ, which is clinically resistant to penicillins, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems etc. We also compared the structures of seven AbaRs identified in GC2 isolates, with the aim of determining the backbone transposon shared by GC2 strains found in Asia, Australia and Europe.

## Materials and methods

### Bacterial strain and susceptibility test

A. baumannii strain MDR-CQ was isolated on 10 June 2016 from the bloodstream of a 55-year-old male patient hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China. The patient suffered from acute XXX. MDR-cQ was considered to be the pathogen that caused the bloodstream infection. Susceptibility testing for MDR-CQ was performed using the XXX according to the manufacture's instructions. The MICs of 33 antimicrobial agents were determined.


### Genome sequencing and assembly

The Genomic DNA of A. baumannii MDR-CQ was prepared with the SDS method. The harvested DNA was detected by the agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by Qubit. The genome of MDR-CQ was sequenced by Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) technology. The low quality reads were filtered by the SMRT 2.3.0 [] and the filtered reads were assemblied to generate one contig without gaps.


### Genome annotation

Annotation of A. baumannii MDR-CQ was finished using the NCBI PGAP annotation pipeline and manually checked. The pipeline uses Genmark to predict open reading frames (ORF) and searches against Proteins Clusters. Protein coding genes were searched against the NCBI RefSeq database using BLASTp. COG functional categories assignment of the ORFs were archived by BLAST against the COG database. InterPro searchs were also done to identify conserved domains in each ORF.

### Comparative genomics analysis


### Nucleotide sequence accession number

The genome sequence of the A. baumannii MDR-CQ chromosome and plasmid pMDR-CQ have been deposited at GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL under the accession numbers CP019114 and CP019115, respectively.


## Results and discussion
### Antibiotic susceptibilities

The MICs of 33 antimicrobial agents are listed in Table 1. A. baumannii strain MDR-CQ was found to be resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides etc. It was susceptible only to tigecycline.  

### Genomic properties

The A. baumannii strain MDR-CQ genome consists of a circular chromosome of 3927258 bp and a plasmid of 75390 bp. General features of the A. baumannii MDR-CQ genome are listed in Table XXX.

### Multilocus sequence typing and phylogeny analysis

Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis  showed that the sequence type (ST) of MDR-CQ under the Oxford scheme  was ST195 (2-3-1-96-3-2-3), and under the Pasteur scheme was ST2 (2-2-2-2-2-2-2), which suggested that strain MDR-CQ is a member of the GC2 group.
